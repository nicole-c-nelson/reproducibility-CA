Weak science, harmful policies, and counterproductive work practices burrowed us into this hole. It's all fueled by unexamined assumptions, cherry-picked data, and anecdote-driven beliefs - and even the way we discuss and try to tackle non-reproducibility can be like that.

This overview is intended for researchers who are committed to improving the quality and integrity of biomedical science by raising awareness of both the sources of irreproducibility, and activities specifically targeted to address the issue. The irreproducibility of biomedical research is due to a variety of factors, known and unknown, that markedly influence experimental outcomes. Among the known factors are inadequate training or mentoring, or experimenter incompetence. These may result in flawed experimental design and execution that reflect a lack of planning, leading to an underpowering of a study, an absence of appropriate controls, selective data analysis, inappropriate statistical analysis, and/or investigator bias or fraud. Another frequently overlooked source of irreproducibility is failure to ensure that the equipment used is performing up to manufacturer specifications. Failure to validate/authenticate the experimental reagents is another source of irreproducibility. These include compounds, cell lines, antibodies, and the animal models used in a study. This overview discusses how a lack of validation of research reagents negatively impact experimental reproducibility, and provides guidelines to avoid these pitfalls. © 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",2018-06-01,2020-07-13 16:56:23,2020-07-13 18:22:03,2018-10-23 18:49:05,e40,,1,81,,,,,,,,,,en,"© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,,,Hand search; Hand search NCN,antibodies; cell lines; compounds; validation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After several publications indicated that a substantial number of scientific reports may not be readily reproducible, the scientific community and public began engaging in discussions about mechanisms to measure and enhance the reproducibility of scientific projects. In this context, several innovative steps have been taken in recent years. The results of these efforts confirm that improving reproducibility will require persistent and adaptive responses, and as we gain experience, implementation of the best possible practices. ![Figure][1]</img> CREDIT: MARK AIRS/GETTY IMAGES > “…improving reproducibility will require…the best possible practices.”  A framework has been developed to promote transparency and openness in scientific publications—the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) guidelines (<http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6242/1422.full>). They cover key principles that apply to many scientific fields, although they were developed primarily by social scientists. The editors at Science have adjusted practices based on these policies and have gained experience with many of these issues. We fully support the principles behind these guidelines, including the centrality and benefits of transparency, as captured in our editorial principle that “all data and materials necessary to understand, assess, and extend the conclusions of the manuscript must be available to any reader” of Science and the Science family of journals. Our editorial policies now contain specific statements for each TOP guideline category. In some cases, we include the possibility of granting specific exceptions but insist that these circumstances be discussed with our editors early in the manuscript evaluation process to allow for thoughtful examination. Another approach to assess reproducibility involved an experimental program that attempted to replicate selected findings in cancer biology by groups not involved with the original studies (see <https://elifesciences.org/collections/9b1e83d1/reproducibility-project-cancer-biology>). Although some findings were largely reproduced, in at least one case (which was published in Science ), the key finding was not. Yet, the initial results have been utilized and extended in published studies from several other laboratories. This case reinforces the notion that reproducibility, certainly in cancer biology, is quite nuanced, and considerable care must be taken in evaluating both initial reports and reported attempts at extension and replication. Clear description of experimental details is essential to facilitate these efforts. The increased use of preprint servers such as bioRxiv by the biological and biomedical communities may play a role in facilitating communication of successful and unsuccessful replication results. Over the past year, we have retracted three papers previously published in Science . The circumstances of these retractions highlight some of the challenges connected to reproducibility policies. In one case, the authors failed to comply with an agreement to post the data underlying their study. Subsequent investigations concluded that one of the authors did not conduct the experiments as described and fabricated data. Here, the lack of compliance with the data-posting policy was associated with a much deeper issue and highlights one of the benefits of policies regarding data transparency. In a second case, some of the authors of a paper requested retraction after they could not reproduce the previously published results. Because all authors of the original paper did not agree with this conclusion, they decided to attempt additional experiments to try to resolve the issues. These reproducibility experiments did not conclusively confirm the original results, and the editors agreed that the paper should be retracted. This case again reveals some of the subtlety associated with reproducibility. In the final case, the authors retracted a paper over extensive and incompletely described variations in image processing. This emphasizes the importance of accurately presented primary data. As this new year moves forward, the editors of Science hope for continued progress toward strong policies and cultural adjustments across research ecosystems that will facilitate greater transparency, research reproducibility, and trust in the robustness and self-correcting nature of scientific results.

Some accomplishments of these initiatives are noted, but this article focuses on why they do not provide a general solution for what ails psychology. There are inherent limitations to mass replications ever being conducted in many areas of psychology, both in terms of their practicality and their prospects for improving the science. Unnecessary compromises were built into the ground rules for design and publication of the Open Science Collaboration: Psychology that undermine its effectiveness. Some ground rules could actually be flipped into guidance for how not to conduct replications. Greater adherence to best publication practices, transparency in the design and publishing of research, strengthening of independent post-publication peer review and firmer enforcement of rules about data sharing and declarations of conflict of interest would make many replications unnecessary. Yet, it has been difficult to move beyond simple endorsement of these measures to consistent implementation. Given the strong institutional support for questionable publication practices, progress will depend on effective individual and collective use of social media to expose lapses and demand reform. Some recent incidents highlight the necessity of this.",2016-05-31,2020-07-13 16:56:19,2020-07-13 18:22:03,2018-10-29 20:13:26,28,,1,4,,BMC Psychology,,,,,,,,,,,,,BioMed Central,,,,,,Hand search; Hand search NCN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The stroke research community was among the first to recognize that the motivations inherent in our system of research can cause investigators to take shortcuts, and can introduce bias and reduce generalizability, all of which leads ultimately to the recurrent failure of apparently useful drug candidates in clinical trials. Here, we review the evidence for these problems in stroke research, where they have been most studied, and in other translational research domains, which seem to be bedevilled by the same issues. We argue that better scientific training and simple changes to the way that we fund, assess and publish research findings could reduce wasted investment, speed drug development, and create a healthier research environment. For 'phase III' preclinical studies—that is, those studies that build the final justification for conducting a clinical trial—we argue for a need to apply the same attention to detail, experimental rigour and statistical power in our animal experiments as in the clinical trials themselves.",2014-01,2020-07-13 16:56:14,2020-07-13 18:22:03,2018-04-05 15:18:44,37-43,,1,10,,,,,,,,,,en,2013 Nature Publishing Group,,,,www.nature.com.ezproxy.library.wisc.edu,,,,,,Hand search; Hand search NCN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are many technical reasons why experimental results, particularly in cancer research, cannot be reproduced, including unrecognized variables in the complex experimental model, poor documentation of procedures, selective reporting of the most-positive findings, misinterpretation of technical noise as biological signal and, in the most extreme cases, fabrication of data. We suggest that cognitive biases in research and flaws in the academic incentive system also contribute to the publication of immature results. Recognition of these factors, which are often not discussed, provides additional strategies to improve reproducibility. We suggest that in addition to establishing better standards of data presentation and creating venues for publication of negative results, some changes to the grant submission and funding system could further improve the reproducibility of research findings.",2013-12,2020-07-13 16:56:14,2020-07-13 18:22:03,2017-07-13 15:47:36,720-724,,12,10,,Nat Rev Clin Oncol,Reproducibility of research and preclinical validation,,,,,,,en,,,,,www-nature-com.ezproxy.library.wisc.edu,,,,,,Hand search; Hand search NCN,Translational research,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following a discussion of a published large-scale replication study and a review of the meta-analysis literature, we come to the conclusion that many effects are small and that on average the variance of the effects is roughly 10% to 25% of the population variance, most likely because of context dependencies. The proposed explanations such as questionable and suboptimal research practices (low power, poor measurement quality, and the use of NHST) are discussed, as well as more distal explanatory factors such as journals, funding agencies, and institutions. Special attention is given to a third kind of explanatory factor that is situated in a psychological reality that comprises small and varying effect sizes. These factors may cause problems even in the absence of researcher-controlled factors. The proposed remedies for proximal problems insist on more power, more replications, more meta-analysis, higher reliability coefficients, and alternatives for NHST. Based on a discussion we formulate critical and less critical remarks regarding these recommendations. We believe there should be room for a diversity of perspectives and approaches. Small and varying effects attributable to complexity and context dependency of human behavior are considered to be great challenges and may lead to an adjustment of research and analysis methods. Finally, open questions are formulated regarding psychological data and data analysis, followed by seven conditional recommendations.

To overcome the limitations that stand between experimental and clinical research, international consortia have attempted to establish standardized guidelines for study design and for reporting the resulting data. In addition, multicenter preclinical randomized controlled trials (pRCTs) have been proposed as a suitable tool for ‘bridging the gap’ between experimental research and clinical trials. We recently reported the design and results of the first such pRCT in which we confirmed the feasibility of using a coordinated approach with standardized protocols in collaboration with independent multinational research centers. However, despite its successes, this first pRCT also had several difficulties, particularly with respect to following the protocols established in the study design and analyzing the data. Here, we review our experiences performing the study, and we analyze and discuss the lessons learned from performing the first pRCT. Moreover, we provide suggestions regarding how obstacles can be overcome to improve the performance and outcome of future pRCT studies. Translational research is hampered by low reproducibility of preclinical studies and countless failed clinical trials. International consortia have proposed preclinical multicenter trials as an intermediate step to overcome this ‘translational roadblock’. We have recently performed the first such preclinical randomized controlled trial (pRCT) by adopting key elements of clinical study design to preclinical research. In this review, we discuss the lessons learned from this trial and provide suggestions how to optimize future pRCTs.

This is a particularly important problem in laboratory organisms that are relatively new, i.e., for which only limited amount of information is available, and for which only a limited number of methods have been developed. The zebrafish is a relative newcomer in behavioral neuroscience. This review considers four distinct reasons as possibly underlying reproducibility issues in behavioral neuroscience studies using the zebrafish. One, publication bias for positive results. Two, statistical issues that surround the question of how to address type 1 and type 2 errors, and how to make statistical inference. Three, inappropriate control of factors that are known to potentially influence results. And four, methodological issues stemming from insufficient understanding of factors that may influence experimental results. The review will mainly focus on experimental issues and solutions, i.e. the latter two reasons listed above.

Sex bias has been highlighted as one of the contributing factors to the poor translation and replicability issues undermining preclinical research. There have been multiple calls for action and the funders of biomedical research are actively pushing the inclusion of sex as a biological variable. Here we consider the current standard practice within the preclinical research setting, why there is a movement to include females, and why the imbalance exists. We explore organisational change theory as a tool to shape strategies needed at an individual and institute level to change the status quo.

Yet, legitimate concerns have been raised about the reproducibility of research findings, with important implications for the advancement of science and for public support. With statistical practice increasingly becoming an essential component of research efforts across the sciences, this review article highlights the compelling role of statistics in ensuring that research findings in the animal sciences are reproducible—in other words, able to withstand close interrogation and independent validation. Statistics set a formal framework and a practical toolbox that, when properly implemented, can recover signal from noisy data. Yet, misconceptions and misuse of statistics are recognized as top contributing factors to the reproducibility crisis. In this article, we revisit foundational statistical concepts relevant to reproducible research in the context of the animal sciences, raise awareness on common statistical misuse undermining it, and outline recommendations for statistical practice. Specifically, we emphasize a keen understanding of the data generation process throughout the research endeavor, from thoughtful experimental design and randomization, through rigorous data analysis and inference, to careful wording in communicating research results to peer scientists and society in general. We provide a detailed discussion of core concepts in experimental design, including data architecture, experimental replication, and subsampling, and elaborate on practical implications for proper elicitation of the scope of reach of research findings. For data analysis, we emphasize proper implementation of mixed models, in terms of both distributional assumptions and specification of fixed and random effects to explicitly recognize multilevel data architecture. This is critical to ensure that experimental error for treatments of interest is properly recognized and inference is correctly calibrated. Inferential misinterpretations associated with use of P-values, both significant and not, are clarified, and problems associated with error inflation due to multiple comparisons and selective reporting are illustrated. Overall, we advocate for a responsible practice of statistics in the animal sciences, with an emphasis on continuing quantitative education and interdisciplinary collaboration between animal scientists and statisticians to maximize reproducibility of research findings.",2018-07-01,2020-07-13 16:52:49,2020-07-13 16:52:49,2018-11-20 18:55:58,5679-5701,,7,101,,Journal of Dairy Science,Invited review,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,PubMed,experimental replication; model specification; multiple testing; statistical errors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lilienfeld's analysis is an important and cogent synopsis of external problems that have limited psychological science's penetration into public knowledge. The current article expands upon this by examining internal problems, or problems within psychological science that have potentially limited its impact with policymakers, other scientists, and the public. These problems range from the replication crisis and defensive reactions to it, overuse of politicized policy statements by professional advocacy groups such as the American Psychological Association (APA), and continued overreliance on mechanistic models of human behavior. It is concluded that considerable problems arise from psychological science's tendency to overcommunicate mechanistic concepts based on weak and often unreplicated (or unreplicable) data that do not resonate with the everyday experiences of the general public or the rigor of other scholarly fields. It is argued that a way forward can be seen by, on one hand, improving the rigor and transparency of psychological science, and making theoretical innovations that better acknowledge the complexities of the human experience.

What are the implications of these changes for productivity, creativity, and progress in psychological science? These questions can and should be studied empirically, and I present my predictions here. The productivity of individual researchers is likely to decline, although some changes (e.g., greater collaboration, data sharing) may mitigate this effect. The effects of these changes on creativity are likely to be mixed: Researchers will be less likely to pursue risky questions; more likely to use a broad range of methods, designs, and populations; and less free to define their own best practices and standards of evidence.

We consider three changes in current practice that have the potential to deliver more realistic and robust claims. First, the planned experiment should be divided into two stages, an exploratory stage and a confirmatory stage. This clear separation allows the researcher to check whether any results found in the exploratory stage are robust. The second change is to carry out adequately powered studies. We show that this is imperative if we want to obtain realistic estimates of effects in psycholinguistics. The third change is to use Bayesian data-analytic methods rather than frequentist ones; the Bayesian framework allows us to focus on the best estimates we can obtain of the effect, rather than rejecting a strawman null. As a case study, we investigate number interference effects in German. Number feature interference is predicted by cue-based retrieval models of sentence processing (Van Dyke & Lewis, 2003; Vasishth & Lewis, 2006), but it has shown inconsistent results.

Recently, the foundations of this paradigm have been shaken by several notable replication failures. One recommendation to remedy the replication crisis is to collect larger samples of participants. We argue that this recommendation misses a critical point, which is that increasing sample size will not remedy psychology’s lack of strong measurement, lack of strong theories and models, and lack of effective experimental control over error variance. In contrast, there is a long history of research in psychology employing small-N designs that treats the individual participant as the replication unit, which addresses each of these failings, and which produces results that are robust and readily replicated. We illustrate the properties of small-N and large-N designs using a simulated paradigm investigating the stage structure of response times. Our simulations highlight the high power and inferential validity of the small-N design, in contrast to the lower power and inferential indeterminacy of the large-N design.

This proposal was criticized and rejected in a response by Lakens et al.

A key component of the NIH Rigor and Reproducibility guidelines is the recording and analysis of ""provenance"" information, which describes the origin or history of data and plays a central role in ensuring scientific reproducibility. As part of the NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K)-funded data provenance project, we have developed a new informatics framework called Provenance for Clinical and Healthcare Research (ProvCaRe) to extract, model, and analyze provenance information from published literature describing research studies. Using sleep medicine research studies that have made their data available through the National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR), we have developed an automated pipeline to identify and extract provenance metadata from published literature that is made available for analysis in the ProvCaRe knowledgebase. NSRR is the largest repository of sleep data from over 40,000 studies involving 36,000 participants and we used 75 published articles describing 6 research studies to populate the ProvCaRe knowledgebase.

To test this hypothesis, we had 14 European laboratories run a simple microcosm experiment using grass (Brachypodium distachyon L.) monocultures and grass and legume (Medicago truncatula Gaertn.) mixtures. Each laboratory introduced environmental and genotypic CSV within and among replicated microcosms established in either growth chambers (with stringent control of environmental conditions) or glasshouses (with more variable environmental conditions). The introduction of genotypic CSV led to 18% lower among-laboratory variability in growth chambers, indicating increased reproducibility, but had no significant effect in glasshouses where reproducibility was generally lower.

These problems are not limited to any specific therapeutic area, academic or industrial research and are due in large part to several generic factors influencing research quality (e.g., related to definition of pre-specified endpoints, principles of study design and analysis, biased reporting, and lack of proper training). Yet, neuroscience drug discovery is often said to be affected more than the other fields. Within neuroscience, behavioral studies are the most blamed for being poorly designed, underpowered and mis-reported and there are indeed several factors that may be rather unique for behavioral research, such as a multitude of environmental conditions that are difficult to control and that are often not reported, ethical concerns about in vivo research and the pressure to reduce animal numbers, contributing to under-powered studies, and the complexity of study design and analysis, creating too much room for post hoc data massaging and selective reporting. Also, the blood-brain barrier as a frequently neglected complicating factor has to be considered in CNS research. The importance of these factors is increasingly recognized and urgent efforts are needed to demonstrate that behavioral methods of preclinical neuroscience research deliver results that can be as robust as with the non-behavioral methods Until this goal is achieved, behavioral neuroscience and neuroscience in general may be losing young talent, CNS drug discovery may lack the needed investment and this field may indeed be amongst the most affected by the current preclinical data quality crisis.",2018-04-15,2020-07-13 16:52:49,2020-07-13 16:52:49,,4-9,,,300,,J.

The reproducibility of preclinical research findings reported by academia in the peer-reviewed literature has been called into question, seriously jeopardizing the value of academic science for inventing therapeutics. AREAS COVERED: The corrosive effects of the reproducibility issue on drug discovery are considered. Purported correctives imposed upon academia from the outside deal mainly with expunging fraudulent literature and imposing punitive sanctions on the responsible authors. The salutary influence of such post facto actions on the reproducibility of discovery-relevant preclinical research data from academia appears limited. Rather, intentional doctoral-scientist education focused on data replicability and translationally-meaningful science and active participation of university entities charged with research innovation and asset commercialization toward ensuring data quality are advocated as key academic initiatives for addressing the reproducibility issue. EXPERT OPINION: A mindset shift on the part of both senior university faculty and the academy to take responsibility for the data reproducibility crisis and commit proactively to positive educational, incentivization, and risk- and reward-sharing practices will be fundamental for improving the value of published preclinical academic research to drug discovery.",2016-09,2020-07-13 16:52:49,2020-07-13 16:52:49,,835-842,,9,11,,Expert Opin Drug Discov,The reproducibility issue and preclinical academic drug discovery,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 27401809,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27401809,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many underlying factors contributing to the prevalence of irreproducible results have been highlighted with a focus on poor design and execution of experiments along with the misuse of statistics. While these factors certainly contribute to irreproducibility, relatively little attention outside of the specialized statistical literature has focused on the expected prevalence of false discoveries under idealized circumstances. In other words, when everything is done correctly, how often should we expect to be wrong? Using a simple simulation of an idealized experiment, it is possible to show the central role of sample size and the related quantity of statistical power in determining the false discovery rate, and in accurate estimation of effect size. According to our calculations, based on current practice many subfields of biomedical science may expect their discoveries to be false at least 25% of the time, and the only viable course to correct this is to require the reporting of statistical power and a minimum of 80% power (1 - β = 0.80) for all studies.",2018-05,2020-07-13 16:52:49,2020-07-13 16:52:49,,226-233,,,151,,Biochem.

We review why degrading p-values into 'significant' and 'nonsignificant' contributes to making studies irreproducible, or to making them seem irreproducible. A major problem is that we tend to take small p-values at face value, but mistrust results with larger p-values. In either case, p-values tell little about reliability of research, because they are hardly replicable even if an alternative hypothesis is true. Also significance (p ≤ 0.05) is hardly replicable: at a good statistical power of 80%, two studies will be 'conflicting', meaning that one is significant and the other is not, in one third of the cases if there is a true effect. A replication can therefore not be interpreted as having failed only because it is nonsignificant. Many apparent replication failures may thus reflect faulty judgment based on significance thresholds rather than a crisis of unreplicable research. Reliable conclusions on replicability and practical importance of a finding can only be drawn using cumulative evidence from multiple independent studies. However, applying significance thresholds makes cumulative knowledge unreliable. One reason is that with anything but ideal statistical power, significant effect sizes will be biased upwards. Interpreting inflated significant results while ignoring nonsignificant results will thus lead to wrong conclusions. But current incentives to hunt for significance lead to selective reporting and to publication bias against nonsignificant findings. Data dredging, p-hacking, and publication bias should be addressed by removing fixed significance thresholds. Consistent with the recommendations of the late Ronald Fisher, p-values should be interpreted as graded measures of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. Also larger p-values offer some evidence against the null hypothesis, and they cannot be interpreted as supporting the null hypothesis, falsely concluding that 'there is no effect'. Information on possible true effect sizes that are compatible with the data must be obtained from the point estimate, e.g., from a sample average, and from the interval estimate, such as a confidence interval. We review how confusion about interpretation of larger p-values can be traced back to historical disputes among the founders of modern statistics. We further discuss potential arguments against removing significance thresholds, for example that decision rules should rather be more stringent, that sample sizes could decrease, or that p-values should better be completely abandoned. We conclude that whatever method of statistical inference we use, dichotomous threshold thinking must give way to non-automated informed judgment.",2017-07-07,2020-07-13 16:52:49,2020-07-13 16:52:49,,e3544,,,5,,PeerJ,The earth is flat (p > 0.05),,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 28698825 PMCID: PMC5502092,,; ,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28698825; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28698825,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Why do outcomes of so many clinical trials contradict each other? Why is the effectiveness of many drugs and other medical interventions so low? Why have prescription medications become the third leading cause of death in the US and Europe after cardiovascular diseases and cancer? In answering these questions, the main culprits identified so far have been various biases and conflicts of interest in planning, execution and analysis of clinical trials as well as reporting their outcomes. In this work, we take an in-depth look at statistical methodology used in planning clinical trials and analyzing trial data. We argue that this methodology is based on various questionable and empirically untestable assumptions, dubious approximations and arbitrary thresholds, and that it is deficient in many other respects. The most objectionable among these assumptions is that of distributional homogeneity of subjects' responses to medical interventions. We analyze this and other assumptions both theoretically and through clinical examples. Our main conclusion is that even a totally unbiased, perfectly randomized, reliably blinded, and faithfully executed clinical trial may still generate false and irreproducible results. We also formulate a few recommendations for the improvement of the design and statistical methodology of clinical trials informed by our analysis.",2017-08-22,2020-07-13 16:52:49,2020-07-13 16:52:49,,127,,1,17,,BMC Med Res Methodol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 28830371 PMCID: PMC5568363,,; ,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28830371; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28830371,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Combined with the low power of most current work, this often leads to the use of misleading criteria about whether an effect has replicated. Rosenthal (1990) suggested more appropriate criteria, here labeled the continuously cumulating meta-analytic (CCMA) approach. For example, a CCMA analysis on a replication attempt that does not reach significance might nonetheless provide more, not less, evidence that the effect is real. Alternatively, measures of heterogeneity might show that two studies that differ in whether they are significant might have only trivially different effect sizes. We present a nontechnical introduction to the CCMA framework (referencing relevant software), and then explain how it can be used to address aspects of replicability or more generally to assess quantitative evidence from numerous studies. We then present some examples and simulation results using the CCMA approach that show how the combination of evidence can yield improved results over the consideration of single studies.",2014-05,2020-07-13 16:52:49,2020-07-13 16:52:49,,333-342,,3,9,,Perspect Psychol Sci,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 26173268,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26173268,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first idea is that the adoption of a low alpha level (e.g., 5%) puts reasonable bounds on the rate at which errors can enter the published literature, making false-positive effects rare enough to be considered a minor issue. This, we point out, rests on statistical misunderstanding: The alpha level imposes no limit on the rate at which errors may arise in the literature (Ioannidis, 2005b). Second, some argue that whereas direct replication attempts are uncommon, conceptual replication attempts are common-providing an even better test of the validity of a phenomenon. We contend that performing conceptual rather than direct replication attempts interacts insidiously with publication bias, opening the door to literatures that appear to confirm the reality of phenomena that in fact do not exist. Finally, we discuss the argument that errors will eventually be pruned out of the literature if the field would just show a bit of patience. We contend that there are no plausible concrete scenarios to back up such forecasts and that what is needed is not patience, but rather systematic reforms in scientific practice.",2012-11,2020-07-13 16:52:49,2020-07-13 16:52:49,,531-536,,6,7,,Perspect Psychol Sci,Is the Replicability Crisis Overblown?,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 26168109,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26168109,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So the standard mode of applying null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) fails to adequately separate stable from random effects. Therefore, NHST does not fully convince as a statistical inference strategy. We argue that the replicability crisis is ""home-made"" because more sophisticated strategies can deliver results the successful replication of which is sufficiently probable. Thus, we can overcome the replicability crisis by integrating empirical results into genuine research programs.

I argue that this crisis follows the failure of widely adopted solutions to psychology's similar crisis of the 1970s. The untouched root cause is an information-economic one: Too many studies divided by too few publication outlets equals a bottleneck. Articles cannot pass through just by showing theoretical meaning and methodological rigor; their results must appear to support the hypothesis perfectly. Consequently, psychologists must master the art of presenting perfect-looking results just to survive in the profession. This favors aesthetic criteria of presentation in a way that harms science's search for truth. Shallow standards of statistical perfection distort analyses and undermine the accuracy of cumulative data; narrative expectations encourage dishonesty about the relationship between results and hypotheses; criteria of novelty suppress replication attempts. Concerns about truth in research are emerging in other sciences and may eventually descend on our heads in the form of difficult and insensitive regulations. I suggest a more palatable solution: to open the bottleneck, putting structures in place to reward broader forms of information sharing beyond the exquisite art of present-day journal publication.

After adjustment for systematic biases, eﬃcacy estimates for various psychotherapy modalities tend to be disappointingly small (Cuijpers et al., 2010b; Cristea et al., 2017a). Some evidence suggests that when eﬃcacy is estimated based exclusively on unbiased highquality trials, eﬀects of psychotherapy could fall below the threshold for clinical relevance (Cuijpers et al., 2014a). Recently, some psychotherapy researchers hence raised the controversial point that eﬀects of both psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for depression may entirely reﬂect a placebo eﬀect (Cuijpers and Cristea, 2015). Of further concern is the gap between treatment eﬃcacy in controlled laboratory trials and treatment eﬀectiveness in naturalistic real-world settings (Westen et al., 2004; Hallfors and Cho, 2007). The literature reviewed in this commentary was restricted to the eﬃcacy of clinical psychological interventions, as that topic is highly relevant for clinical psychology. Nevertheless, conﬂicting and irreproducible ﬁndings have been detected and discussed in various other hot topics within clinical psychology, including the debatable eﬀect of menopause on the occurrence of depression (Rössler et al., 2016; Hengartner, 2017), the putative consequences of violent video games (Ferguson and Kilburn, 2010; Calvert et al., 2017), or inconsistent associations between psychopathology and stress physiology (Chida and Hamer, 2008; Rosmalen and Oldehinkel, 2011). Even though the replication crisis was mostly addressed within social psychology, I conclude that it is no less pernicious and prevalent in clinical psychology. Psychotherapy was a marvelous invention, but initial enthusiasm regarding its eﬃcacy has now been obfuscated due to scientiﬁc biases that systematically inﬂate estimates. Being aware of these issues may certainly improve our scientiﬁc and clinical endeavors.",2018-02-28,2020-07-13 16:52:03,2020-07-13 16:52:03,2018-10-22 02:57:40,,,,9,,,Raising Awareness for the Replication Crisis in Clinical Psychology by Focusing on Inconsistencies in Psychotherapy Research,,,,,,,en,,,,,Crossref,,,,,,psychology; efficacy; Meta-analysis; PubMed; Publication Bias; Replication; clinical medicine; crisis; WebofSci; allegiance; clinical psychology; effectiveness; methodology; Psychotherapy Research; Reporting bias,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And how should “failed” replications affect our belief in the validity of the original research? In this paper, we consider the replication debate from a historical and philosophical perspective, and provide a conceptual analysis of both replication and falsiﬁcation as they pertain to this important discussion.

The field of rodent behavioral phenotyping was one of the first to raise this concern, and to relate it to other methodological issues: the complex interaction between genotype and environment; the definitions of behavioral constructs; and the use of laboratory mice and rats as model species for investigating human health and disease mechanisms. In January 2015, researchers from various disciplines gathered at Tel Aviv University to discuss these issues. The general consensus was that the issue is prevalent and of concern, and should be addressed at the statistical, methodological and policy levels, but is not so severe as to call into question the validity and the usefulness of model organisms as a whole.

Regardless of the extent of current knowledge regarding the human genome‡ and relatively low genotyping costs, the value of pharmacogenetic studies in improving understanding of variable drug response remains contentious. Failure to replicate initial significant findings in subsequent studies is one reason for this and problems with methodological quality has been cited as contributing to this lack of replication. Here, concerns raised in the literature regarding the methodological quality of genetic association studies in general are discussed with particular consideration given to how applicable they are to the conduct and reporting of pharmacogenetic studies. Some of these issues such as sample size and quality of genotypes‡ have been given significant attention in the literature already whereas others, such as dealing with missing genotypes and assumptions regarding mode of inheritance, have been discussed very little. Issues of quality believed to be uniquely relevant to pharmacogenetic studies are also considered. These discussions close with an assessment of how well the issues are dealt with in pharmacogenetic studies published over recent years and, overall, methodological quality is found to be poor. A checklist is provided of issues to be addressed whenever a future pharmacogenetic study is embarked upon. Referring to this checklist will improve the chances of replication and instil confidence in the integrity of future pharmacogenetic studies. It will also serve as a tool in assessing methodological quality of studies included in a systematic review of pharmacogenetic studies.

The Reproducibility Project: Psychology sought to replicate the effects of 100 psychology studies. Though 97% of the original studies produced statistically significant results, only 36% of the replication studies did so (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). This inability to replicate previously published results, however, is not limited to psychology (Ioannidis, 2005). Replication projects in medicine (Prinz et al., 2011) and behavioral economics (Camerer et al., 2016) resulted in replication rates of 25 and 61%, respectively, and analyses in genetics (Munafo, 2009) and neuroscience (Button et al., 2013) question the validity of studies in those fields. Science, in general, is reckoning with challenges in one of its basic tenets: replication. Comparative psychology also faces the grand challenge of producing replicable research. Though social psychology has born the brunt of most of the critique regarding failed replications, comparative psychology suffers from some of the same problems faced by social psychology (e.g., small sample sizes). Yet, comparative psychology follows the methods of cognitive psychology by often using within-subjects designs, which may buffer it from replicability problems (Open Science Collaboration, 2015).

This crisis in turn has driven changes in standards for research methodologies and prompted calls for the creation of open-access data repositories and the preregistration of research hypotheses. Although we should embrace the creation of repositories and registries, and the promise for greater statistical power, reproducibility, and generalizability of research findings they afford, we should also recognize that they alone are no substitute for sound design in minimizing study confounds, and they are no guarantor of faith in the validity of our pathogenic theories, findings, and biomarkers.

We posit that a contributor is simply a lack of specificity that is required to enable adequate research reproducibility. In particular, the inability to uniquely identify research resources, such as antibodies and model organisms, makes it difficult or impossible to reproduce experiments even where the science is otherwise sound. In order to better understand the magnitude of this problem, we designed an experiment to ascertain the ""identifiability"" of research resources in the biomedical literature. We evaluated recent journal articles in the fields of Neuroscience, Developmental Biology, Immunology, Cell and Molecular Biology and General Biology, selected randomly based on a diversity of impact factors for the journals, publishers, and experimental method reporting guidelines. We attempted to uniquely identify model organisms (mouse, rat, zebrafish, worm, fly and yeast), antibodies, knockdown reagents (morpholinos or RNAi), constructs, and cell lines. Specific criteria were developed to determine if a resource was uniquely identifiable, and included examining relevant repositories (such as model organism databases, and the Antibody Registry), as well as vendor sites. The results of this experiment show that 54% of resources are not uniquely identifiable in publications, regardless of domain, journal impact factor, or reporting requirements. For example, in many cases the organism strain in which the experiment was performed or antibody that was used could not be identified. Our results show that identifiability is a serious problem for reproducibility. Based on these results, we provide recommendations to authors, reviewers, journal editors, vendors, and publishers. Scientific efficiency and reproducibility depend upon a research-wide improvement of this substantial problemin science today.",2013-09-05,2020-07-13 16:52:03,2020-07-13 16:52:03,,UNSP e148,,,1,,PeerJ,On the reproducibility of science,,,,,,,English,,,,,Web of Science,,WOS:000209189200002,,,,biomedicine; WebofSci; methodology; reporting; specificity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite obvious and relatively inexpensive solutions to improve reproducibility—ensuring that experimental reagents, specifically cancer cell lines and antibodies, are authenticated/validated before use and that best practices in statistical usage are incorporated into the design, analysis, and reporting of experiments—these are routinely ignored, a reflection of hubris and a comfort with the status quo on the part of many investigators. New guidelines for the peer review of publications and grant applications introduced in the past year, while well-intended, lack the necessary consequences, e.g., denial of funding, that would result in sustained improvements when scientific rigor is lacking and/or transparency is, at best, opaque. An additional factor contributing to irreproducibility is a reductionist mindset that prioritizes certainty in research outcomes over the ambiguity intrinsic to biological systems that is often reflected in “unknown unknowns”. This has resulted in a tendency towards codifying “rules” that can provide “yes-no” outcomes that represent a poor substitute for the intellectual challenge and skepticism that leads to an awareness and consideration of “unknown unknowns”. When acknowledged as potential causes of unexpected experimental outcomes, these can often transition into the “knowns” that facilitate positive, disruptive innovation in biomedical research like the human microbiome.

It calls into question whether psychology is a science. Existing conceptualizations of replicability depend on effect sizes; the larger the population effect size, the greater the probability of replication. This is problematic and contributes to the replication crisis. A different conceptualization, not dependent on population effect sizes, is desirable. The proposed solution features the closeness of sample means to their corresponding population means, in both the original and replication experiments. If the researcher has specified the sampling precision desired, it is possible to calculate the probability of replication, prior to data collection, and without dependence on the population effect size or expected population effect size. In addition, it is not necessary to know population means or standard deviations, nor sample means or standard deviations, to employ the proposed a priori way of thinking about replicability.",2018-11-17,2020-07-13 16:52:03,2020-07-13 16:52:03,2018-10-22 02:56:58,1188-1214,,8,31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,,,,,psychology; statistics; recommendations; crisis; WebofSci; samples,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Often, the first study showed a statistically significant result but the replication does not. Questions then arise about whether the first study results were false positives, and whether the replication study correctly indicates that there is truly no effect after all. This article suggests these so-called failures to replicate may not be failures at all, but rather are the result of low statistical power in single replication studies, and the result of failure to appreciate the need for multiple replications in order to have enough power to identify true effects. We provide examples of these power problems and suggest some solutions using Bayesian statistics and meta-analysis. Although the need for multiple replication studies may frustrate those who would prefer quick answers to psychology’s alleged crisis, the large sample sizes typically needed to provide firm evidence will almost always require concerted efforts from multiple investigators. As a result, it remains to be seen how many of the recently claimed failures to replicate will be supported or instead may turn out to be artifacts of inadequate sample sizes and single study replications.

Biomedical and health informatics is unlikely to be immune to these challenges. This paper explores replication in informatics and the unique challenges the discipline faces. Methods: Narrative review of recent literature on research replication challenges. Results: While there is growing interest in re-analysis of existing data, experimental replication studies appear uncommon in informatics. Context effects are a particular challenge as they make ensuring replication fidelity difficult, and the same intervention will never quite reproduce the same result in different settings. Replication studies take many forms, trading-off testing validity of past findings against testing generalizability. Exact and partial replication designs emphasize testing validity while quasi and conceptual studies test generalizability of an underlying model or hypothesis with different methods or in a different setting. Conclusions: The cost of poor replication is a weakening in the quality of published research and the evidence-based foundation of health informatics. The benefits of replication include increased rigor in research, and the development of evaluation methods that distinguish the impact of context and the nonreproducibility of research.

The expectation is that most statistically significant findings can be replicated in new data and in new laboratories, but in practice many findings have replicated less often than expected, leading to claims of a replication crisis. We review recent methodological literature on questionable research practices, meta-analysis, and power analysis to explain the apparently high rates of failure to replicate. Psychologists can improve research practices to advance knowledge in ways that improve replicability. We recommend that researchers adopt open science conventions of preregi-stration and full disclosure and that replication efforts be based on multiple studies rather than on a single replication attempt. We call for more sophisticated power analyses, careful consideration of the various influences on effect sizes, and more complete disclosure of nonsignificant as well as statistically significant findings.",2018-01-04,2020-07-13 16:52:03,2020-07-13 16:52:03,,487-510,,,69,,Annu Rev Psychol,"Psychology, Science, and Knowledge Construction",,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 29300688,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29300688,psychology; recommendations; PubMed; crisis; WebofSci,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

W2FLMD6R,journalArticle,2016,"Schulz, Jörg B.; Cookson, Mark R.; Hausmann, Laura",The impact of fraudulent and irreproducible data to the translational research crisis - solutions and implementation,Journal of Neurochemistry,,1471-4159,10.1111/jnc.13844,,"One of the aims of basic neuroscience research is ultimately the development of therapeutics to cure diseases. Funders granting money to research institutions increasingly express interest into how their financial resources are used and look for successful translation in clinical practice. Disappointingly, many findings that started out promising in basic research projects and phase I trials did not live up to the promise of therapeutic efficacy in later phase II or III trials. An inordinately high amount of time and money is thus spent on research that does not always have the required human impact. Potential reasons for these problems are numerous. Although research misconduct occurs and contributes to this shortcoming, it is not the only important factor. Frequently, basic science results turn out to be irreproducible. Irreproducibility, outside of malfeasance, is multifactorial and can include poor experimental design, conduct, statistical analysis, reporting standards, and conceptual flaws. Further confounding problems include an insufficient transferability of animal to human physiology, as well as intersubject group variability, for example, sexual dimorphisms. While the causes of poor data reproducibility are therefore numerous, equally there are many groups that can contribute to improvements in how basic science is reported. Here, we will review how the Journal of Neurochemistry can contribute to increasing the value of preclinical and translational research. Despite a vast amount of very promising basic research findings, these failed to successfully translate into the clinical practice so far. The reasons for this 'data reproducibility crisis' are numerous, for example, rooting in insufficient experimental design, conceptual flaws, incorrect statistical planning and evaluation, incomplete model system that do not adequately reproduce the human physiology, and further reasons discussed in this Review with the aim to present practical solutions that can be implemented by researchers, journals editors, and reviewers. We will also explain measures the Journal of Neurochemistry have implemented to overcome these issues and weaknesses in preclinical research. These includes adherence to the ARRIVE ( www.nc3rs.org) guidelines, NINDS standards (doi: 10.1038/nature11556), and The Transparency and Openness Promotion Guidelines (TOP) Committee guidelines (https://cos.io/top/#TOP).

These critiques as well as failures to replicate several high-profile studies have been used as justification to proclaim a ""replication crisis"" in psychology. Psychologists are encouraged to conduct more ""exact"" replications of published studies to assess the reproducibility of psychological research. This article argues that the alleged ""crisis of replicability"" is primarily due to an epistemological misunderstanding that emphasizes the phenomenon instead of its underlying mechanisms. As a consequence, a replicated phenomenon may not serve as a rigorous test of a theoretical hypothesis because identical operationalizations of variables in studies conducted at different times and with different subject populations might test different theoretical constructs. Therefore, we propose that for meaningful replications, attempts at reinstating the original circumstances are not sufficient. Instead, replicators must ascertain that conditions are realized that reflect the theoretical variable(s) manipulated (and/or measured) in the original study.",2014-01,2020-07-13 16:52:03,2020-07-13 16:52:03,,59-71,,1,9,,Perspect Psychol Sci,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 26173241,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26173241,psychology; epistemology; PubMed; WebofSci; conceptual crisis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We contend that model replicability, or independent researchers' ability to obtain the same output using original code and data, and model reproducibility, or independent researchers' ability to recreate a model without original code, serve different functions and fail for different reasons. This means that measures designed to improve model replicability may not enhance (and, in some cases, may actually damage) model reproducibility. We claim that although both are undesirable, low model reproducibility poses more of a threat to long-term scientific progress than low model replicability. In our opinion, low model reproducibility stems mostly from authors' omitting to provide crucial information in scientific papers and we stress that sharing all computer code and data is not a solution. Reports of computational studies should remain selective and include all and only relevant bits of code.",2018-10-31,2020-07-13 16:52:49,2020-07-13 16:52:49,2018-11-20 18:43:59,,,,,,J Comput Neurosci,Replicability or reproducibility?,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,,,PubMed,Computational modeling; Direct and conceptual replication; Methodology of computational neuroscience; Replication and reproduction; Replication studies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If theoretical predictions are weak we should not rely on all or nothing hypothesis tests. Different inferential methods may be most suitable for different types of research questions. Whenever researchers use NHST they should justify its use, and publish pre-study power calculations and effect sizes, including negative findings. Hypothesis-testing studies should be pre-registered and optimally raw data published.

The usefulness of mouse models has been questioned because of irreproducibility and poor recapitulation of human conditions. Newer studies, however, point to bias in reporting results and improper data analysis as key factors that limit reproducibility and validity of preclinical mouse research. Inaccurate and incomplete descriptions of experimental conditions also contribute. Here, we provide guidance on best practice in mouse experimentation, focusing on appropriate selection and validation of the model, sources of variation and their influence on phenotypic outcomes, minimum requirements for control sets, and the importance of rigorous statistics. Our goal is to raise the standards in mouse disease modeling to enhance reproducibility, reliability and clinical translation of findings.",2016-02-01,2020-07-13 16:56:19,2020-07-13 18:22:03,2018-10-18 20:02:56,101-103,,2,9,,,Using the mouse to model human disease,,,,,,,en,"© 2016.

Recent developments in social psychology (such as fraudulent research by D. Stapel) and cell biology (the Amgen Inc. and Bayer AG reports on how rarely they could reproduce published results) have become widely known. Nearly every field is affected, from clinical trials and neuroimaging, to economics and computer science. Obvious solutions include more research on statistical and behavioral fixes for irreproducibility, activism for policy changes, and demanding more pre-registration and data sharing from grantees. Two Perspectives in this issue (pp. [1420][2] and [1422][3]) describe how journals and academic institutions can foster a culture of reproducibility. Transparency is central to improving reproducibility, but it is expensive and time-consuming. What can be done to alleviate those obstacles? ![Figure][1]</img> “Transparency is central to improving reproducibility…”  PHOTO: © EDWARD ROZZO/CORBIS Most scientists aspire to greater transparency, but if being transparent taps into scarce grant money and requires extra work, it is unlikely that scientists will be able to live up to their own cherished values. Thus, one of the most effective ways to promote high-quality science is to create free open-source tools that give scientists easier and cheaper ways to incorporate transparency into their daily workflow: from open lab notebooks, to software that tracks every version of a data set, to dynamic document generation. Moreover, scientists who use open-source software are not locked into proprietary software platforms with unclear monetization plans. If philanthropy or government funds new tools that the open-source community can iterate and improve on, the per-dollar return on investment can far exceed the costs. Infrastructural tools are now available, or in development, that should help to catalyze a change in scientific transparency. One example is the Open Science Framework (OSF), a free and open-source software platform for managing scientific workflow (supported by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation in partnership with the Center for Open Science). Among its many features, this platform can enable scientists to easily track the history of all versions of every document or data set and the exact contributions made by each team member. All project materials can be given persistent identifiers, and the tracking of provenance allows any subsequent research project to give proper credit to the original. Projects using this platform include the Shared Access Research Ecosystem project of the Association of Research Libraries and its partners. This project endeavors to connect scholarly metadata and allow the identification of various elements of a research project, such as grant proposals, journal articles, and data repository information. Open-source platform innovations are growing. Other examples include the iPython project (supported largely by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation), which offers a web-based computing notebook for users to create documents such as code, computational results, and narrative explanations. Although originally developed around the Python language, the project has expanded to cover other languages (such as R) under the banner of Project Jupyter. The Galaxy Project (funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and others) provides a web-based platform for “data-intensive” biomedical research; and for managing bioinformatics and phylogenetic research on plants, there is the iPlant Collaborative. The scientific community cannot depend entirely on volunteers or the private market to develop free platforms that address specialized scientific needs and encourage greater reproducibility. Ultimately, the infrastructure supporting science is a public good, just like the knowledge it produces. By supporting such infrastructure, the public and philanthropic sectors can make it painless for researchers to live up to their own values of openness and rigor.

This can be a substantial problem in many fields, such as cancer research, where drugs are initially tested using a cell line derived from the targeted type of tumor (1). If a drug is tested on the wrong cell line, research can lead to unreliable results, and discovery of effective treatments can be delayed. Even in basic research, use of mistaken cell lines can hinder progress because of variations in cell behavior among different cell types. Given these concerns, developing corrective measures for cell line misidentification and contamination warrants renewed attention.

Publishing norms emphasize novel, positive results. As such, disciplinary incentives encourage design, analysis, and reporting decisions that elicit positive results and ignore negative results. Prior reports demonstrate how these incentives inflate the rate of false effects in published science. When incentives favor novelty over replication, false results persist in the literature unchallenged, reducing efficiency in knowledge accumulation. Previous suggestions to address this problem are unlikely to be effective. For example, a journal of negative results publishes otherwise unpublishable reports. This enshrines the low status of the journal and its content. The persistence of false findings can be meliorated with strategies that make the fundamental but abstract accuracy motive—getting it right—competitive with the more tangible and concrete incentive—getting it published.

Of the hypothesized problems, perhaps the most worrying is a worsening of positive-outcome bias. A system that disfavours negative results not only distorts the scientific literature directly, but might also discourage high-risk projects and pressure scientists to fabricate and falsify their data. This study analysed over 4,600 papers published in all disciplines between 1990 and 2007, measuring the frequency of papers that, having declared to have “tested” a hypothesis, reported a positive support for it. The overall frequency of positive supports has grown by over 22% between 1990 and 2007, with significant differences between disciplines and countries. The increase was stronger in the social and some biomedical disciplines. The United States had published, over the years, significantly fewer positive results than Asian countries (and particularly Japan) but more than European countries (and in particular the United Kingdom).

First, we show that despite empirical psychologists’ nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.",2011-11-01,2020-07-13 16:56:14,2020-07-13 18:22:03,2018-11-04 21:27:51,1359-1366,,11,22,,Psychol Sci,False-Positive Psychology,,,,,,,en,,,,,SAGE Journals,,,,,,psychology; Hand search; Hand search RRPs; early years; recommendations; transparency; positive results,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two variants of psi are precognition (conscious cognitive awareness) and premonition (affective apprehension) of a future event that could not otherwise be anticipated through any known inferential process. Precognition and premonition are themselves special cases of a more general phenomenon: the anomalous retroactive influence of some future event on an individual's current responses, whether those responses are conscious or nonconscious, cognitive or affective. This article reports 9 experiments, involving more than 1,000 participants, that test for retroactive influence by 'time-reversing' well-established psychological effects so that the individual's responses are obtained before the putatively causal stimulus events occur. Data are presented for 4 time-reversed effects: precognitive approach to erotic stimuli and precognitive avoidance of negative stimuli; retroactive priming; retroactive habituation; and retroactive facilitation of recall. The mean effect size (d) in psi performance across all 9 experiments was 0.22, and all but one of the experiments yielded statistically significant results. The individual-difference variable of stimulus seeking, a component of extraversion, was significantly correlated with psi performance in 5 of the experiments, with participants who scored above the midpoint on a scale of stimulus seeking achieving a mean effect size of 0.43. Skepticism about psi, issues of replication, and theories of psi are also discussed.

This increases the scientific validity of the results, and maximises the knowledge gained from each experiment. A minimum amount of relevant information must be included in scientific publications to ensure that the methods and results of a study can be reviewed, analysed and repeated. Omitting essential information can raise scientific and ethical concerns. We report the findings of a systematic survey of reporting, experimental design and statistical analysis in published biomedical research using laboratory animals. Medline and EMBASE were searched for studies reporting research on live rats, mice and non-human primates carried out in UK and US publicly funded research establishments. Detailed information was collected from 271 publications, about the objective or hypothesis of the study, the number, sex, age and/or weight of animals used, and experimental and statistical methods. Only 59% of the studies stated the hypothesis or objective of the study and the number and characteristics of the animals used. Appropriate and efficient experimental design is a critical component of high-quality science. Most of the papers surveyed did not use randomisation (87%) or blinding (86%), to reduce bias in animal selection and outcome assessment. Only 70% of the publications that used statistical methods described their methods and presented the results with a measure of error or variability. This survey has identified a number of issues that need to be addressed in order to improve experimental design and reporting in publications describing research using animals.

We review this hypothesis here and present a proof of principle based on data from a multilaboratory study on behavioral differences between inbred mouse strains. Our findings suggest that environmental standardization is a cause of, rather than a cure for, poor reproducibility of experimental outcomes.

This order is intuitive and reflected in many features of academic life, but whether it reflects the “hardness” of scientific research—i.e., the extent to which research questions and results are determined by data and theories as opposed to non-cognitive factors—is controversial. This study analysed 2434 papers published in all disciplines and that declared to have tested a hypothesis. It was determined how many papers reported a “positive” (full or partial) or “negative” support for the tested hypothesis. If the hierarchy hypothesis is correct, then researchers in “softer” sciences should have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases, and therefore report more positive outcomes. Results confirmed the predictions at all levels considered: discipline, domain and methodology broadly defined. Controlling for observed differences between pure and applied disciplines, and between papers testing one or several hypotheses, the odds of reporting a positive result were around 5 times higher among papers in the disciplines of Psychology and Psychiatry and Economics and Business compared to Space Science, 2.3 times higher in the domain of social sciences compared to the physical sciences, and 3.4 times higher in studies applying behavioural and social methodologies on people compared to physical and chemical studies on non-biological material. In all comparisons, biological studies had intermediate values. These results suggest that the nature of hypotheses tested and the logical and methodological rigour employed to test them vary systematically across disciplines and fields, depending on the complexity of the subject matter and possibly other factors (e.g., a field's level of historical and/or intellectual development). On the other hand, these results support the scientific status of the social sciences against claims that they are completely subjective, by showing that, when they adopt a scientific approach to discovery, they differ from the natural sciences only by a matter of degree.",2010-04-07,2020-07-13 16:56:14,2020-07-13 18:22:03,2018-10-29 20:02:25,e10068,,4,5,,PLOS ONE,,,,,,,,en,,,,,PLoS Journals,,,,,,Hand search; Hand search RRPs; bias; social sciences; positive results; hard sciences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Critics even go so far as to talk about a ""reproducibility crisis"" in the life sciences, a novel headword that increasingly finds its way into numerous high-impact journals. Viewed from a cynical perspective, Fett's law of the lab ""Never replicate a successful experiment"" has thus taken on a completely new meaning. So far, poor reproducibility and translational failures in animal experimentation have mostly been attributed to biased animal data, methodological pitfalls, current publication ethics and animal welfare constraints. More recently, the concept of standardization has also been identified as a potential source of these problems. By reducing within-experiment variation, rigorous standardization regimes limit the inference to the specific experimental conditions. In this way, however, individual phenotypic plasticity is largely neglected, resulting in statistically significant but possibly irrelevant findings that are not reproducible under slightly different conditions. By contrast, systematic heterogenization has been proposed as a concept to improve representativeness of study populations, contributing to improved external validity and hence improved reproducibility. While some first heterogenization studies are indeed very promising, it is still not clear how this approach can be transferred into practice in a logistically feasible and effective way. Thus, further research is needed to explore different heterogenization strategies as well as alternative routes toward better reproducibility in animal experimentation.",2017,2020-07-13 16:52:49,2020-07-13 18:22:03,,343-349,,9,46,,Lab Anim (NY),,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 29296016,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29296016,Hand search; Hand search NCN; PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The success of these programs depends on the validity of published findings. This validity, represented by the reproducibility of published findings, has come into question recently as investigators from companies have raised the issue of poor reproducibility of published results from academic laboratories. Furthermore, retraction rates in high impact journals are climbing.  Methods and Findings To examine a microcosm of the academic experience with data reproducibility, we surveyed the faculty and trainees at MD Anderson Cancer Center using an anonymous computerized questionnaire; we sought to ascertain the frequency and potential causes of non-reproducible data. We found that ∼50% of respondents had experienced at least one episode of the inability to reproduce published data; many who pursued this issue with the original authors were never able to identify the reason for the lack of reproducibility; some were even met with a less than “collegial” interaction.  Conclusions These results suggest that the problem of data reproducibility is real. Biomedical science needs to establish processes to decrease the problem and adjudicate discrepancies in findings when they are discovered.",2013-05-15,2020-07-13 16:52:03,2020-07-13 18:22:03,2017-08-14 16:02:53,e63221,,5,8,,PLOS ONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,PLoS Journals,,,,,,biomedicine; Hand search; Hand search NCN; translational research; WebofSci; interviews,drug discovery; Reproducibility; Drug research and development; Biomarkers; Cancer drug discovery; Research laboratories; Surveys; Trainees,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
